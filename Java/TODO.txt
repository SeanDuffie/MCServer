# List of things to be done

    - [x] Restore Backup Process
        1. Stop Server
        2. Print a list of backup history (Maybe format this like a git branch tree)
        3. Allow user to pick the backup to use from the enumeration
        4. Save existing world
        5. (is this necessary?) Clear active folder
        6. Unzip chosen backup to the active folder
        7. Restart Server
    - [x] Launch Process
        1. Run current or switch worlds
        2. If switching worlds, pick world
            - Print list of existing worlds
            - Add an option for new world from scratch
            - Perform backup on current world
        3. After picking new world, decide whether to save current one
        4. If generating new world from scratch, pick the jar file of the desired version
            - Auto generate the eula?
    - [ ] History json in active directory (will be included in backups)
        - Name of the world
        - Name (zipname or path) of the previous backup
        - Forge, Paper, or Vanilla?
        - Type of backup (Daily, Hourly, Manual, Revert)
        - If Manual or Revert, state reason for backup
        - Mod or plugin list?
